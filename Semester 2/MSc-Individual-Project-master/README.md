# MSc-Individual-Project


This is my application for MSc Individual Project

To start the application simply download the ''Application' folder and run the file named 'Application'

On startup you will be asked to speak into the microphone. 

As you do this the application will record your voice, if a certain amount of time passes and no shouting is heard the application will discard the recorded talking.

If any shouting is heard while the application is running it will store X amount of seconds of talking before the shouting is heard and will continue to store until 5 seconds of silence is heard

When 5 seconds of silence is heard the application will save a .wav file into the folder that the application is stored in
