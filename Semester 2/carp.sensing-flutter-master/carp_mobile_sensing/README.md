# CARP Mobile Sensing Framework in Flutter

This library contains the software architecture for the CARP sensing framework implemented in Flutter.
Supports cross-platform (iOS and Android) sensing.

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/carp_mobile_sensing.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/carp_mobile_sensing)

For Flutter plugins for other CARP products, see [CARP Mobile Sensing in Flutter](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/blob/master/README.md).

## Usage
To use this plugin, add `carp_mobile_sensing` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

### Android Integration

Add the following to your app's `manifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main`:

````xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="<your_package_name>"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools">

   ...
   
   <!-- The following permissions are used for CARP Mobile Sensing -->
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS" tools:ignore="ProtectedPermissions"/>

</manifest>
````
Note that version 0.5.0 is migrated to AndroidX. This shouldn't result in any functional changes, but it requires any Android apps using this plugin to also 
[migrate](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate) if they're using the original support library. 
See Flutter [AndroidX compatibility](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/androidx-compatibility)



### iOS Integration

Add this permission in the `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner`:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
  <array>
  <string>bluetooth-central</string>
  <string>bluetooth-peripheral</string>
  <string>external-accessory</string>
  <string>fetch</string>
</array>

```


## Documentation

The [Dart API doc](https://pub.dartlang.org/documentation/carp_mobile_sensing/latest/) describes the different libraries and classes.

The [wiki](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing/wiki) contains detailed documentation on the CARP Mobile Sensing Framework, including 
the [domain model](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing/wiki/Domain-Model), its built-in [probes](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing/wiki/Probes), 
and how to [extend](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing/wiki/Extending) it.

Below is a few simple / minimum examples (a better description is available on the [wiki](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/wiki/Domain-Model)).

## Examples

In the following example, a study is created "by hand", i.e. you specify each task and measure in the study.

```dart
// Import package
import 'package:carp_mobile_sensing/carp_mobile_sensing.dart';

some_method() async {
  // Create a study using a File Backend
  Study study = Study("1234", "bardram", name: "bardram study");
  study.dataEndPoint = FileDataEndPoint()
    ..bufferSize = 500 * 1000
    ..zip = true
    ..encrypt = false;

  // add sensor collection from accelerometer and gyroscope
  // careful - these sensors generate a lot of data!
  study.addTask(Task('Sensor Task')
    ..addMeasure(PeriodicMeasure(MeasureType(NameSpace.CARP, SensorSamplingPackage.ACCELEROMETER),
        frequency: 10 * 1000, // sample every 10 secs)
        duration: 100 // for 100 ms
        ))
    ..addMeasure(PeriodicMeasure(MeasureType(NameSpace.CARP, SensorSamplingPackage.GYROSCOPE),
        frequency: 20 * 1000, // sample every 20 secs
        duration: 100 // for 100 ms
        )));

  study.addTask(Task('Task collecting a list of all installed apps')
    ..addMeasure(Measure(MeasureType(NameSpace.CARP, AppsSamplingPackage.APPS))));

  // Create a Study Controller that can manage this study, initialize it, and start it.
  StudyController controller = StudyController(study);
  await controller.initialize();
  controller.start();

  // listening on all data events from the study
  controller.events.forEach(print);

  // listen on only CARP events
  controller.events.where((datum) => datum.format.namepace == NameSpace.CARP).forEach(print);

  // listening on a specific probe
  ProbeRegistry.probes[DataType.LOCATION].events.forEach(print);
}
```

However, you can se up a study quite simple, by using [sampling schemas](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/wiki/Schemas#sampling-schema).
Below is an example of this:

`````dart
 StudyController controller = StudyController(
    study,
    samplingSchema: SamplingSchema.common(),
  );

  await controller.initialize();
  controller.start();

  // listening on all data events from the study
  controller.events.forEach(print);
`````

There is a very **simple** [example app](example/main.dart) app which shows how a study can be created with different tasks and measures.
This app just prints the sensing data to a console screen on the phone.

However, the [CARP Mobile Sensing App](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/tree/master/carp_mobile_sensing_app) 
provides a **MUCH** better example of how to use the package in a Flutter BLoC architecture, including good documentation of how to do this.
