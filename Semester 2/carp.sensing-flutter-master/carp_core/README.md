[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/carp_core.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/carp_core)

This library does nothing in itself, but provides the domain model for 
the other CARP plugins. See [CARP Mobile Sensing in Flutter](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/blob/master/README.md).

The [domain model](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/wiki/Domain-Model) is
described on the CARP Mobile Sensing Framework in Flutter [wiki](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/wiki).

## Usage

To use this plugin, add `carp_core` as a [dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).
