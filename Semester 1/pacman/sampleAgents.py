# Some simple agents to work with the PacMan AI projects from:

# http://ai.berkeley.edu/
#
# These use a simple API that allow us to control Pacman's interaction with
# the environment adding a layer on top of the AI Berkeley code.
#
# As required by the licensing agreement for the PacMan AI we have:
